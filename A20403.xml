            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For it is wrytten pſal. lxxxviii Who is that man that lyuyth / and ſhall not ſee deth / as whoo ſayth. Noon. Therfore receyue me pacyently for I come to the to do no noueltye. For Seneca ſaith. Noman is ſo vnwiſe / but he knowith he ſhaldye. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe whan deth drawith nere he dredith and we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pith. Why wepiſt thou man.

This happid to thifader / to thimoder / to thy bettirs alſo. and generally to all that haue bene before the / and it ſhall not fayle to come to all them that ſhal be. For lyfe is not geuyn to any creature with excepcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deth. Ther is a law vnyuerſall / which ordeynith to be born and to dye all thinge that berith lyfe. And al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo he ſaith. We owe to ſuffir pacyently that thing that we may not eſcape fro. Example of Dauid that ſayde whan his childe was dede.

Whan it was ſhewyd vnto a philoſofre that his ſonne was ded he anſwerde and ſayde. whan I gate him. I knew he ſhulde dye.

Sainte Ierome tellyth that an holy woman / and mooſte noble / whan her huſbonde was dede who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe eſpecyally louyd and mournyd and his body lay vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buryed in the ſame daye of his buryinge ſhe loſte tway ſonnes which ſhe hadde and no moo. I am to tell a thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge incredyble ſaith ſaynt Ierome / but God by wytneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe not falſe. Who wold not haue trowyd / that ſhe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghte a goone pluckynge her breſtis / her clothis teryng her herys downe hangynge / certaynly from her fel not a droope of terys. She ſtoode immoueable / and fallynge downe to the feete of cryſte / ſhe helde them and ſayde / I am ſpedde good lorde and redy to thy ſeruyce / for thou haſt diſchargyd me of ſo greate a burdon. It is redde al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo in the cronycles of Emperowrs / that the wyſe of Oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tauyan buryed her ſonne namyd druſe. And though ſhe were a paynyme / neuertheleſſe by the greate Naturall ſenſe that was in her / ſhe put from her all the tokyns of merowre and heuyneſſe / that were in her and ſayde. What profit is to drede that may not be reuokyd / wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Seneca ſaith / a wyſeman is not afflycte for loſſe of his children or frendes. For in ſuche mode he may ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtayne ther deth / as he daylye awaytith for his owne. And truly the Remembraunce of deth is lyke a brydell refraynynge a man that he efflowe not to moche / and

Rynne in the greate brede of couetyſe and lechery. The meditacyon of deth. Is mooſt greate philoſofre as ſaith Plato. Wherfore it is tolde in the lyfe of Saynt Iehan the ampuere. That in the olde tyme aftir that an Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perowre was crownyd / by the Eleccyon of his Lordes / Immediatelye maſons / and makers of tombis wente vnto him and ſayde. O Emperowre of what ſtone or metall wylt thow commaunde thy graue to be made.

That whan Alexander was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and to him was made a Sepulchre of Golde / many philoſofres came thedir togider. And oon of them ſayde Alexander made his Treſowre of Golde / and nowe in contrarywyſe Golde hath made Creſowre of him / an othir ſayde.

of ſynne. It is ſayde of a lyuynge man / that he ſhallbe deſtroyde at laſt / and rote lyke a downghil. Iob .xx. Therfore it is commaundyd Eccleſiaſt .vii. Remembir the ende. For it is bettyr to goo to an hows of lamenta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon and wepinge / than to an hows of welfare &amp; glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For ther as is mourninge / the laſte ende of euery Creature is remembryd. And a man thinkyth what ſhall fall to him ſelf / that is to ſaye that he ſhall come to ſuche an ende. Therfore attende ye and conſydre wel that in the deth of euery creature / the nooſe waxith col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de / the teth blacke.

It is nat hangid in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre / for corrupcyon. But lyke poyſon moſt perylows / It is caſt in to a pytte no more to be ſene / and erth is lyghtlye caſt on it. Beholde the ioye of the worlde howe it endith. It is cloſyd in a mooſt ſtynkynge dyche. where the harte conſumyth. The Iendrye vp. The erys fall from the hede. The nooſe rotith from the face. The tonge ſtyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kith in the mowth. The harte putrifieth in the bodye. But alas alas goode lorde to me. what ſhuld theſe yen delyghte to ſee fayre thinges. The erys te here vany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teys. The nooſe to ſmell ſwete thinges. The tonge to ſpeke fowle thinges and vnprofitable. The mowth to taſte ſwete thinges. The harte to thinke vayne and vyle thinges. wherfore Bernarde ſaith. why art thou prowde / thow aſſhyn and duſte. The concepcyon of the is ſynne. Thy byrth is myſery.
